### Day Planner
An app that helps manage your day with current and hourly weather, storing and display your daily events, storing and displaying your "To Do" list, and giving you news from 
Guardian News that can also be searched!

## Tech
Networking with Retrofit & Moshi, OpenWeather API, Guardian News API, Location Services, MVVM Architecture, LiveData, & Repository Pattern, View & Data Binding, 
Room for Data Persistence, Coroutines & Kotlin Flow, Notifications with Alarm Manager, RecyclerView with ViewDataBinding & a custom binding adapter for images, 
Dependency Injection with Dagger2, Espresso UI Testing, Navigation and SafeArgs, Picasso for Image Handling, Material Design Elements, Material Motion Transitions,
custome launcher icon, Dialogs, Alerts, and DialogFragments, Date & Time Picker Dialogs, Intents for sharing, messaging, and driving directions.


I believe this application is an excellent representation of my current skill level, but I will to continue to update it. Some of my future updates will be 
merge/include of layouts, improved overall theme and the inclusion of a night theme, switches to adjust between Imperial/Metric and Day/Night Themes, a rotation of 
randomly chosen quotes for the splash page, dependency injection for the APIs, and more testing.
