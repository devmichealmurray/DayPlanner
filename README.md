I believe this application is an excellent representation of my current skill level, but I will to continue to update it. Some of my future updates will be 
merge/include of layouts, improved overall theme and the inclusion of a night theme, switches to adjust between Imperial/Metric and Day/Night Themes, a rotation of 
randomly chosen quotes for the splash page, dependency injection for the APIs, and more testing.
